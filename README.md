README Generator

## Description

The motivation for this project is to allow users to create a README file using simple questions. 

I built this project to solve a need for people who want a more efficent way to make a README file.

This project shows off my skills working with JavaScript and Node.js.

I learned a lot about Node.js and installing applications to use in the terminal.

## Installation 

Node.js and inquirer

## Usage

After installing Node.js and inquirer, open the terminal. In the terminal the user will navigate to the proper folder and file. When the file path is set correctly, type in node index.js. This will show one question at a time to be answered by the user until the README file data is collected. When the questions are all answered navigate to the exampleREADME.md. The user can then open the preview to view the file created.
